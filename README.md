# ProtoMapper 

## Overview And Goals

ProtoMapper is a program that will aim to be a very useful tool for indie game developers. It will also serve as a fun 
project for me to develop in the meantime. I am currently working on this project in my spare time between work and 
other responsibilities, but I hope it will be widely used one day.

When it comes to things like level design and pathfinding, some game developers struggle to meet their goals. One of the 
possible reasons for this is the wide range of advice that, at the end of the day, is largely theoretical. Applying all of 
it to one specific project can make getting started a bit rough.

Take level design, for example. Do I go with procedurally generated levels, predefined levels, or endless? If I want to 
predefine a level, what's the most effecient way to do that? Do I draw a bunch of obstacles in some painting program, make 
note of the pixel coordinates, and hard code them into my game? Do I simply try coding in numbers that "seem good" and keep 
iterating over it until I have a level that's playable? Do I use strings to visually draw my level? 

What about pathfinding? How do I know that all the NPCs in my game will behave the way I expect? Will I choose the wrong algorithm 
and release a game that uses more system reources than what is necessary? Will I mistakingly place a route destination on the wrong side 
of an important wall, causing the NPC to get stuck or reveal some hidden speedrun short cut in the level I didn't intend to create?

Of course, at least from a level design perspective, many of the bigger game engines typically include tools that help you get started 
in a reasonably productive way. However, these engines usually streamline the entire development process using *their* way of making games. 
Not everyone can, or wants to, develop their games using these engines. Some of us have a natural engineering curiosity, and using programs 
that take some of the "engineering" out of software engineering can put a person off.

*ProtoMapper aims to empower developers with a balance between convenience and flexibility.* Game developers will be able to design their 
levels in a user-friendly environment and export them in a format that best suits their unique project. They'll also be able to prototype 
any pathfinding requirements that their game may have. They'll be able to play with any combination of design approaches and algorithms 
they want until they find that sweet spot they were looking for.

## Current Development State

ProtoMapper is currently in the **very early stages of development.** Much of the program's core codebase is still coming together, and no 
working prototype exists yet. 

If you are interested in seeing this project grow, please give the repository a star. 

For inquiries about the project, you can contact me via the email address on my Github profile.
