# List of TODOs

**This is a compilation of things that need done in the short-term. I try to make them very descriptive so that I don't forget.**

## High Priority TODOs

The following items need to be designed/decided on and implemented: 
- [ ] UI elements to be constructed from UIContainer, data stored within .ini files.
- [ ] Should we support multiple external script engines for users to use?
- [ ] What data format will be used to automate UI building?
- [ ] How will projects be organized in data format? 

The following items need to be tested and polished:
- [ ] The ResourceManager's polymorphic allocator. Does it work correctly?
- [ ] Mouse and keyboard handling.
- [ ] Handling of window related events.

## Low Priority TODOs

- [ ] Figure out a method of compressing/hidding shaders and other assets so they are not easily tampered with.
- [ ] Decide whether to allow external scripts to define UI components, if so, how.
- [ ] Compile sample text, assets, and other things for testing.
- [ ] Figure out how to make things pretty in the UI.
